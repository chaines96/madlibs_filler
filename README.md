# Madlibs Filler

A program which inserts words in a string of text at indicated points with randomly chosen words much like a Mad Libs activity. 

To build this program, run 'cargo build'. This program requires the rand crate, so be sure to run 'cargo add rand 0.8.5' if the corresponding entry is not present in Cargo.toml.
